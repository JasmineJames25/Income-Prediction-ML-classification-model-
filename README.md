# Income-Prediction-ML-classification-model

### The dataset provided to us contains 32560 rows, and 14 different independent features. We aim to predict if a person earns more than 50k$ per year or not. Since the data predicts 2 values (>50K or <=50K), this clearly is a classification problem, and we will train the classification models to predict the desired outputs. Mentioned below are the details of the features provided to us, which we will be feeding to our classification model to train it.
